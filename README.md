# PIXU Front End Development Course Page

For this technical challenge, I was tasked with designing a website, then building it on HTML and CSS.
I opted for the option of designing a site which lets a user book onto a training course. 

## Design

I first created a logo for the course using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). The blue colour I chose for this became the starting point for the colour palette which I worked with for the rest of the project. I used the [Eye Dropper](https://eyedropper.org/) Chrome extension tool to get the HEX code for this colour, then used an online tool called [Color Blender](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/color-blend/#:::hex) to get 10 hues of colour between the selected blue and white, which gave me my colour palette. I also used a [Colour Contrast Checker](https://colourcontrast.cc/) to make sure the colours I chose passed AAA accessibility standards when used in conjunction with each other.

I then decided on what else the design would need:

1. A clear value proposition stating what the website offers and why users should chose this training course.
2. A simple, minimalistic, user centered design.
3. Clear information hierarchy using visual cues such as size, placement, and font weight.
4. A contact section with a call to action.
5. Some images to bring the design to life. I used [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) for this.
6. A form for the user to submit their details.
7. A footer with links to social media platforms, I used [Icons8](https://icons8.com/icons) for this.

It's worth mentioning that I also used a few similar websites for inspiration, including [Makers](https://makers.tech/), [Command Shift](https://www.commandshift.co/) and [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/education/front-end-web-development/london).

I then used [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to make the design, you can see the finished version below:
